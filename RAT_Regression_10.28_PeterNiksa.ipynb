    "Linear Regression: What is it?\n",
    "Linear Regression allows us to develop a functional approximation of a dataset where the parameters of the functions are linearly dependent on functions of the dataset variables i.e. $M\\cdot\\alpha=\\gamma$, where $M$ is some tensor in the indices of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, $\\alpha$ is a coefficient tensor and $\\gamma$ is some tensor that depends on the dataset.\n",
    "One particular example is a first order polynom that has two coefficients $b$ and $m$ and the function is $f(x)=m*x+b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Regression:\n",
    "Describes regression methods for which the data-set $X$ on which a potentially dependent variable $y$ is related to is multi-dimensional, i.e. the case for which the above linear regression would have more complex tensors.\n",
    "In general, although with a different name, $y$ can also be multi-dimensional.\n",
    "These types of regression can be linear but also non-linear."
